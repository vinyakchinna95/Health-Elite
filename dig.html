            <li>Limit saturated fats and trans fats: High-fat foods, especially those containing unhealthy fats, can worsen liver health. Limiting these fats can help reduce inflammation and liver damage.</li>
            <li>Limit salt: Excessive salt can lead to fluid retention and worsen symptoms of liver disease. Limiting salt intake can help manage these symptoms.</li>
            <li>Small, frequent meals: Eating smaller, more frequent meals can help manage symptoms such as bloating and discomfort.</li>
            <li>Hydration: Staying hydrated is important for overall health and can help thin the bile, making it easier to flow through the ducts.</li>
            <li>Limit alcohol: Alcohol can worsen liver damage, so it's important to limit or avoid alcohol consumption.</li>
            <li>Vitamin and mineral supplements: Some people with PSC may benefit from vitamin and mineral supplements, especially fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and calcium.</li>

          <strong><u>Pancreatitis:</u></strong>"Pancreatitis is the inflammation of the pancreas. It can be acute or chronic and is often caused by gallstones, alcohol consumption, certain medications, or high levels of triglycerides in the blood. Pancreatitis can lead to severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or organ failure. Treatment typically involves hospitalization, pain management, intravenous fluids, and addressing the underlying cause."
          <h4><u>Common Symptoms of Pancreatitis:</u></h4>
          <ul>

          <h4><u>Foods that May Help to Manage Pancreatitis:</u></h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Clear liquids: During acute pancreatitis flare-ups, clear liquids like water, broth, and clear fruit juices can help provide hydration without putting strain on the pancreas.</li>
            <li>Low-fat foods: Foods that are low in fat are easier for the pancreas to digest. Lean protein sources like skinless chicken, turkey, and fish are good options.</li>
            <li>High-protein foods: Protein is important for healing and maintaining muscle mass. Choose lean protein sources like eggs, tofu, and low-fat dairy products.</li>
            <li>Complex carbohydrates: Foods high in complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, can provide energy without aggravating the pancreas.</li>
            <li>Healthy fats: While a low-fat diet is generally recommended for pancreatitis, incorporating small amounts of healthy fats like olive oil, avocados, and nuts can help meet your body's nutritional needs.</li>
            <li>Probiotic-rich foods: Probiotics can help maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria, which is important for digestive health. Yogurt with live cultures and fermented foods like sauerkraut can be beneficial.</li>
            <li>Small, frequent meals: Eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day can help reduce the workload on the pancreas and prevent overloading the digestive system.</li>
            <li>Hydration: Staying hydrated is important for overall health and can help thin the pancreatic secretions, making them easier to pass.</li>
