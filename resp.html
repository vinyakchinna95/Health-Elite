            <li><strong><u>Asthma:</u></strong> Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing. While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can be managed through medication, lifestyle changes, and, in some cases, natural remedies.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4><u>Common Symptoms of Asthma:</u></h4>
          <l>
            <li>Shortness of breath</li>
            <li>Wheezing</li>
            <li>Chest tightness</li>
            <li>Coughing, especially at night or early morning</li>

              <strong><u>COPD:</u></strong>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways, which leads to airflow limitation and difficulty breathing. The two main conditions that fall under the umbrella of COPD are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Like asthma, COPD is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management and treatment.</li>

          <strong><u>Cystic Fibrosis:</u></strong>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the respiratory and digestive systems. It results in the production of thick and sticky mucus that can clog airways and lead to respiratory and digestive problems. CF symptoms can vary widely among individuals, and the severity of the condition can range from mild to severe.

            <ol>
              <li>High-calorie and nutrient-dense foods: Since individuals with CF may have difficulty absorbing nutrients, consuming foods that are both high in calories and nutrient-dense is important to meet nutritional needs.</li>
              <li>Avocados, nut butters, olive oil: These are sources of healthy fats that can contribute to a higher calorie intake.</li>
              <li>Lean proteins: Including lean proteins, such as poultry, fish, and tofu, can help support muscle growth and repair.

          <strong><u>Pneumonia:</u></strong>Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting the air sacs, primarily caused by infection. It can lead to symptoms such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Proper medical treatment, including antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia, is essential for managing the infection. In addition to medical care, certain dietary considerations may help support recovery.

          <strong><u></u>Interstitial Lung Disease(ILD):</u></strong>Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) is a group of lung disorders characterized by inflammation and scarring of the interstitium, the tissue that surrounds and supports the air sacs of the lungs. Symptoms of ILD can include shortness of breath, persistent dry cough, fatigue, and unexplained weight loss. While ILD is a complex condition that requires medical management, certain dietary and lifestyle considerations may help support overall health.
