      <h2>What Is A Balanced Diet?</h2>
      <p>A balanced diet gives your body the nutrients it needs to function correctly. It should include a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, which provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber; whole grains, which are a good source of complex carbohydrates and fiber; legumes, which offer protein, fiber, and a range of micronutrients; nuts, which provide healthy fats, protein, and essential vitamins and minerals; and lean proteins, which are crucial for muscle repair and overall body function. A diet rich in these foods supports overall health, aids in digestion, helps maintain a healthy weight, and reduces the risk of chronic diseases.
